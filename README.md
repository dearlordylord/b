The outlines and seam endpoints share the same coordinates. Each curved seam
stays inside a convex section of its arm. BendTT checks the general algebraic
proofs; Bend checks the concrete artwork before emitting SVG. An independent
Python checker also inspects the resulting SVG.

## Generate and check

Requirements: Bend **2.0.34**, a C compiler supported by Bend, Python 3, and GNU
`timeout`. The proof gate additionally requires Bend's BendTT kernel for
`--verdict`; this repository does not install toolchains automatically.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dearlordylord/b.git
cd b
./regenerate.sh
python3 check.py
```

`regenerate.sh` checks the proofs with BendTT, compiles and executes
`generate.bend`, checks the emitted SVG, and replaces `b.svg` only on success.
The generator itself refuses to emit an SVG if its Bend artwork validation fails.

`check.py` runs the 49-law proof gate, 200 literal arithmetic checks,
seven executed validator boundary checks, compiling mutations that must fail
proofs, invalid artworks that must be rejected before SVG emission, and Bend
and independent Python topology fixtures. Python checks the output artifact;
it does not verify the Bend language.

## How the geometry works

`artwork.bend` contains three arms with 33 paired left/right cross sections each.
`core.bend` derives their outlines, shadows and quadratic Bezier seams from
these shared records. Coordinates are exact natural numbers in hundredths of
a pixel. SVG uses the same integer viewBox, with no floating-point conversion
or decimal rounding. The outline is a densely sampled polygon; the seams are
continuous quadratic curves.

For each seam, the containing tile has corners `L0, L1, R1, R0`. The seam starts
at `L0`, ends at `R0`, and has control point:

```text
C = (L0 + L1 + R0 + R1) / 4
```

The artwork coordinates make this division exact. All 96 tiles are strictly
convex; 24 selected sections carry visible seams.

## What is proved and checked

`LAWS.bend` states five claims, proved in `PROOF.bend`:

1. Every seam starts on its arm's left boundary.
2. Every seam ends on the right boundary of the same cross section.
3. SVG serialization uses those exact boundary coordinates.
4. Each coordinate of the quadratic seam equals a nonnegative weighted
   combination of the four tile corners, under the exact-centroid premise.
5. The corner weights sum to the correct denominator.

For `t = u / (u + v)`, the weights are `4v² + 2uv`, `2uv`, `4u² + 2uv`, `2uv`,
with total `4(u + v)²`. Auxiliary proofs establish a positive denominator when
either parameter is positive. This places every rational-parameter point of
the seam in the tile's convex hull.

For the full continuous SVG curve, containment follows from continuity and
the closed convex hull. That real-analysis step is mathematical reasoning,
not a theorem over a real-number type inside Bend.

The proof is conditional on exact centroids and convex tiles. Before generation,
`validation.bend` checks the actual coordinate bounds, section counts, all
96 tiles for convexity, centroids and seam endpoints, widths of 18–26 px,
and forward transverse seam derivatives. These are finite executed checks,
distinct from universal formal proofs.

`verify.py` independently parses the actual SVG using exact integer arithmetic.
It checks the same geometric conditions, shadow interpolation, and absence of
boundary self-intersections within each arm. It can catch serialization and
manual-editing mistakes.

Containment concerns the seam's mathematical centerline. Rendering uses butt
caps, a 1.5 px seam stroke, and a 2.8 px closed outline with round joins drawn
over the seams. The topology checks below concern the closed **fill**, rather
than the expanded strokes. Global curvature smoothness and perceptual
readability are not formal claims.

### Validator proofs

`validation-laws.bend` and `validation-proof.bend` add six universal claims:
validation is sound and complete relative to the explicit recursive conditions;
the bounds gate rejects when closed; unbounded sections are rejected; and the
artwork gate is sound and complete, including the exact 33-section count.
These prove traversal and combination of predicates. They do not yet prove
that the U32 geometric predicates implement their natural-number formulas
without overflow. Bounds and overflow limits are documented in the code and
checked on the concrete artifact.

### Fill topology

`topology.bend` builds the intersection graph of the 96 closed convex tiles.
Each arm must be an embedded ribbon: consecutive tiles share a full edge
with opposite interiors, and nonadjacent tiles do not intersect. The three
ribbons must be connected through their intersections.

Every triangle clique requires an exact common-intersection witness. Pairwise
overlap alone is insufficient. Witness search uses vertices and rational
points with denominator 64 along vertex-pair segments; unsuccessful search
rejects conservatively. Coordinates must be divisible by four and at most
16000 before scaling. Five-cliques are rejected, so the accepted nerve has
no simplices beyond tetrahedra.

The current nerve has **96 vertices, 146 edges, 64 triangles and 15
tetrahedra**, giving Euler characteristic `96 - 146 + 64 - 15 = -1`.
With one connected component this means **two holes**. Counts are computed
from geometry, not supplied as acceptance constants.

The mathematical bridge uses planar Helly's theorem (common intersection of
every triple establishes the intersection of a larger convex family), the
[finite closed convex nerve theorem](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768430/),
and the planar relation `holes = components - Euler characteristic`.
Those general topology theorems and correctness of the intersection algorithm
are **not formalized in Bend** here.

`topology-laws.bend` and `topology-proof.bend` add four universal proofs:
the report filter is sound and complete relative to its declared conditions,
the input guard closes on failure, and connectivity of three ribbons matches
the explicit eight-case specification. Together with the original five and
six validator claims, these geometry and report modules contain 15 public laws.

`topology_verify.py` independently clips polygons with exact rational arithmetic
and counts actual intersections in every dimension. It confirms one component
and two holes directly from the serialized SVG. Its fixtures include an empty
triple despite pairwise overlap, a filled five-clique, point contact and a gap.
The generator rejects an artwork unless both geometry and topology gates pass.

## Arithmetic programme (in progress)

[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) records the autonomous four-stage programme. The
current BendTT gate checks **49 public laws**, plus supporting lemmas.
Arithmetic results quantify over all inputs at arbitrary word widths; the U32
operation laws cover every 32-bit constructor payload.

The proved arithmetic foundations are:

- Exact Nat orientation model: edge reversal exchanges its determinant sums.
- Full-adder and whole-word value conservation, including the high carry.
- A strict sum bound below `2^n` implies zero carry and exact Base addition.
- Exact bounded Nat conversion, including Base `U32.from_nat` and its round trip.
- Every word lies below capacity; retained shifts preserve full value and a
  bounded double agrees with Base `Word.shl`.
- The actual Base shift-and-add loop and bounded multiplication are exact;
  unused overflowing trailing shifts need no extra premise.
- Direct bounded `U32.add` and `U32.mul` agree with the natural-number formulas.
- Word and U32 comparisons agree with Nat comparison, including the U32
  equality, greater-than and less-or-equal predicates used by geometry.
- Bitwise complement sums with its input to the representable maximum;
  maximum plus one equals capacity.
- Subtraction carry characterizes borrowing, and actual Word/U32 subtraction
  equals Nat subtraction whenever the minuend is at least the subtrahend.

The `word-*.bend` modules define these models, laws, proofs and fixtures;
`arithmetic-*-proof.bend` contains supporting order and product algebra.
Fixtures invoke the theorems, cover all three-bit comparisons and complements,
and include a bounded product whose unused shift overflows. Compiling mutations
must fail the corresponding proof gate. The subtraction comparison-selector
mutant fails in the shared `carry_step` lemma, rather than its public law section. Each kernel invocation has a five-second
limit. The seven concrete validator examples run as compiled native tests;
they are finite executed checks, distinct from the universal BendTT laws.

**Stage 1 remains incomplete:** division, instantiation of
bounds for actual geometric expressions and their final exact-model agreement
are outstanding. Intersection correctness, enumeration correctness and the
formal topological bridge in stages 2–4 are also outstanding. Finite artwork
checks and the externally justified topology certificate remain as described
above; they are not substitutes for these universal proofs.
